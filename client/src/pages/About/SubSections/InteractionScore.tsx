        DGIdb calculcates two types of scores when searching for an interaction,
        the Query Score and the Interaction Score.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Interaction Score is a static score, meaning that it doesn't changed
        from search to search. It is based on the evidence of an interaction. It
        uses evidence scores, the ratio of average known gene partners for all
        drugs to the known partners for the given drug, and the ratio of average
        known drug partners for all genes to the known partners for the given
        gene (see figure below). Since the Interaction Score depends on numbers
        of drug and gene partners, as well as number of supporting publications
        and sources, as sources are updated and new claims are added the
        Interaction Score may change over time as well. However, between
        updates, the Interaction Score will remain static, regardless of the
        search set. The Interaction Score is also displayed on an individual
        interaction's page.

        Overview of DGIdbâ€™s new Query Scores and interaction scores. A)
        Schematic of how each of the scores is calculated within DGIdb. Gene and
        drug queries both return a Query Score that is dependent on the search
        terms. Each interaction has an Interaction Score that is calculated
        independently of other search terms. B) Example of a Query Score
        changing based on the terms searched. In the first panel, only MEK1 and
        MEK2 were searched and the Interaction Score for the interaction between
        MEK1 and Cobimetinib was 9.76. In the second panel, BRAF and KRAS were
        added to the search query. These both interact with Cobimetinib and thus
        raise the Query Score. C) Example of Interaction Score. The panel on the
        left shows the interaction between ZEB1 and Salinomycin. This is the
        only interaction for Salinomycin and thus it has a high Interaction
        Score. The panel on the right shows the interaction between ZEB1 and
        Doxorubicin. Doxorubicin is involved in 87 interactions within DGIdb and
        thus has a much lower Interaction Score. Note that over time, as sources
        are updated and new claims are added, both Query Scores and Interaction
        Scores may change.
